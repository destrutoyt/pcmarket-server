## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the **backend of PC Market**, a full-stack web application that allows users to **buy and sell custom PCs**.  
The backend is built with **Spring Boot**, handles REST APIs, business logic, database interactions, and JWT-based authentication.  

A MVP/demo of the project will be released soon. Check my [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/users/destrutoyt/projects/2) for more information (daily updates)!

💡 **NOTES** 
- This backend is part of a full-stack project. The frontend or client-side is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/destrutoyt/pcmarket-client).
- MVP release will contain core features, but it is not the final design and it may contain errors.
- Documentation will be created shortly after MVP release.
